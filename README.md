# sanity-formik-yup

Demo repo for a tutorial on Sanity for [Form Validation with Formik and Yup](https://www.sanity.io/guides/form-validation-with-npm-yup). Original author: [Joseph Udonsak](https://www.sanity.io/exchange/community/ybjozee).

Note that the `back-end` folder contains only the schemas for reference. You should still create your own studio per instructions in the guide.
